# Project Title & goal:
Good afternoon,
I just received the attached labor statistics data from 2017 to 2020.
Just in time for our next round of high school visits!
Can you please create a dashboard that seniors can use to explore
wage and employment trends, and compare them across industries?
Thanks!
P.S. A map showing differences across states would help a ton :)

# How to Use:

3) also look into composition of employees for that industry by pie chart.
4) look into last 4 year data to look for trend by employee composition vs wage.
5) look into map data to check which state has more average wages or employees per 1000 capita by industry.
